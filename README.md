# Predictive Modeling Workflow for Automotive Data

This repository provides a complete workflow for predictive modeling using machine learning techniques, focusing on automotive data. It demonstrates end-to-end processes, including data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and interpretation.

## Features

### 1. Data Exploration
- Load and analyze the dataset (`adverts.csv`) to understand its structure.
- Identify missing values, data distributions, and potential features for predictive modeling.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values and outliers.
- Engineer new features (e.g., `vehicle_age`) and scale numerical features.
- Split data into training, validation, and test sets.

### 3. Model Building
- Build machine learning pipelines for both categorical and numerical data.
- Train and tune multiple regression models:
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Linear Regression
  - Linear Support Vector Regressor
- Use GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Evaluate models using RMSE, MAE, and R² scores.
- Visualize results with:
  - Actual vs. Predicted plots
  - Residuals distribution
  - Feature importance

### 5. Model Interpretation
- Use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to explain feature importance and analyze model decisions.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Model Interpretation**: SHAP

## Results
- Summary of the best model based on validation RMSE.
- Insights into feature contributions and model performance.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure `adverts.csv` is available in the root directory.
3. Install required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the script in any Python environment to replicate the workflow.
